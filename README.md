## Welcome <a name="welcome"></a>
Hi everyone! Welcome to the "AUC Image Tagging App". This app has been developed by two undergraduate students at the American University in Cairo (AUC) to help the AUC librarians in their tagging process for the records at the library. This app is intended to be used by authorized AUC librarians only, so if you're not an AUC librarian, you won't have access to the Google Drive folder that the app is dependent upon and you won't be able to use the app.
